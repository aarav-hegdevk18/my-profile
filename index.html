        <p>
            My name is Aarav Hegde and I am 12 years old. I live in the UK and go to school at Queen Elizabeth Boys. I live with my parents and my younger sister. I really enjoy playing cricket and other sports like tennis and swimming. I also like chess and coding. As well as this, I really like Maths and reading. In the future, I want to become either an investment banker, a data analyst for the Indian Cricket Team or AI and risk consultant.

           I live in London, but Bangalore holds a special place in my heart. Visiting my grandparents is always a joyful experience. I cherish family moments, playing cricket with cousins, and exploring the city. Bangalore's warmth and energy remind me of the deep connections I have with my roots and family.

            Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a book that changed my life. The thrill of the Triwizard Tournament, the bonds of friendship, and the courage displayed by Harry and his friends inspired me to be brave in my own life. It is a story that continues to resonate with me deeply.

        <h3>Cricket</h3>
        <p>
            Cricket is my passion. The thrill of playing and watching RCB's IPL win after 18 years is unforgettable. Virat Kohli's emotion reflected my own, showing the deep love and dedication to the sport. India's 2024 World Cup victory felt like a personal triumph, reminding me that cricket is more than a game—it's a dream.
